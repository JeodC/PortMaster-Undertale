## Installation
Download the Windows or Linux version from Steam or GOG and put all gamedata in `ports/undertale/gamedata`. You want to copy over the contents of the folder that has all the `.ogg` files. For Windows this is just `/Undertale`, for Linux this is `/Undertale/assets`.

Disclaimer: There are Undertale fan translations out there, but those require v1.001 of the game--a much earlier version. There may be a separate port in the future to support this multi-language option.
